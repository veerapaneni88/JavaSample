          <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary caretaker is willing to meet some, but not all, of the client's basic needs.</span>           
              <ul>
                <li>Primary caretaker is unwilling to meet some of the client's basic needs for safe shelter, adequate nutrition, hygiene, and access to health care. </li>
                <li>Primary caretaker is unwilling to accept or arrange for help from family, friends, and/or community resources to meet the client's needs, resulting in some of the client's needs being unmet. </li>
				<li>Primary caretaker is unwilling to meet his/her own needs, which contributes to a decline in the quality of care available to the client.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <br>          
          <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary caretaker is unwilling to meet most or all of the client's basic needs.</span>
              <ul>
                <li>Primary caretaker is unresponsive to most or all of the client's basic needs (e.g., primary caretaker ignores the client's requests for assistance with basic care).</li>
                <li>Primary caretaker is unwilling to the use client's resources to meet the client's basic needs.</li>
				<li>Primary caretaker demonstrates physical or emotional fatigue and is unwilling to address this fatigue, resulting in negative consequences for the client.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>     
        </ol>

		<strong>Factors impacting ability to provide care:</strong> Ability includes the authority and/or knowledge/skills to act physically, intellectually, emotionally, financially, etc. When considering the caretaker's ability, include caregiving knowledge and skills as well as functional ability to complete the required tasks or arrange for those tasks to be completed through other means (e.g., the ability to lift a client who is unable to transfer or to arrange for a home health aide).
