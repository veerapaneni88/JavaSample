  <p>  Immediate interventions are actions recommended specifically to mitigate any current danger factors identified during Case Initiation or during Face to Face Contact.
    They should address current considerations for safety rather than long-term changes.
    Immediate interventions should be implemented in accordance with state and local policies and procedures.
    Mark all interventions recommended by the caseworker to mitigate identified current danger factors, then indicate whether the alleged victim/client accepts the intervention(s).
