    <h1 class="shieldPopupHeading">Immediate Interventions Instructions and Definitions</h1>
	
    Immediate interventions are actions recommended specifically to mitigate any current danger factors identified during Case Initiation or during Face to Face Contact. They should address current considerations for safety rather than long-term changes. Immediate interventions should be implemented in accordance with state and local policies and procedures. Mark all interventions recommended by the caseworker to mitigate identified current danger factors, then indicate whether the alleged victim/client accepts the intervention(s).

	<h2 style="font-size: 11pt;">Instructions</h2>
	
    <ul>
      <li>Describe the actions recommended by the caseworker to mitigate identified current danger factors.</li>
      <li>Indicate whether the alleged victim/client accepts the intervention(s) </li>
      <li>More than one safety intervention type may be recommended for one danger factor, and service acceptance or refusal must be indicated for each intervention. </li>
	  <li>When multiple dangers are present, complete a row for each. </li>
	  <li>When selecting actions for recommendation, it is important to begin with the least restrictive interventions that can effectively mitigate current danger factors.</li>
	</ul>
